# Numerical Methods for Solving the Wave Equation
### James Saslow

This was a final project for my upper division Computational Physics during my undergraduate studies. I was very interested with simulating vibrational modes of curvilinear 2D membranes to understand how unique structures could store energy. Since I was approaching any arbitrary 2D manifold, I had to make use of differential geometry in order to derive a Laplacian operator for a given surface. I examined a vibrating plane, disk, sphere, and torus.
